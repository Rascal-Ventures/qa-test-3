# Welcome to QA test ðŸ‘‹

You have recently joined a team working on a greenfield app build. As part of your daily role, you have been given the following code in a PR for you review. Can you please take some time to review the code and carry out the following tasks:

**Code Review**:
- Please review the module and point out bugs, inefficiencies, and potential issues.
- Focus on areas like performance, error handling, edge cases, and best practices.

**Bug Identification:**
- Document all potential issues, including the ones related to missing features like API error handling, memory leaks, etc.
- Suggested Improvements:
- Request recommendations for improving the code, such as optimising performance, improving UX, and ensuring better error handling.

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Can you describe test scenarios you would run (manual and automated) to ensure the module functions correctly. This can include unit tests, integration tests, or exploratory tests.

**Edge Cases:**
- Think about edge cases, such as handling very long task lists, duplicate tasks, empty inputs, and network connectivity issues.

**Automated test:**
- Take the test scenario you identified above to ensure the module runs correctly and create an automated test for this using Detox or a similar testing tool.
